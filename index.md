You are welcome to my page. My name is Adekunle Opeoluwa Ajayi, I am a doctoral student of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_oceanography" target="_blank">Physical Oceanography</a> at the University Grenoble Alpes, (<a href="http://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/" target="_blank">UGA</a>) France. I am a member of <a href="http://meom-group.github.io/" target="_blank">MEOM</a>, a computational oceanography research group of the Institut des Géosciences de l'Environnement (<a href="http://www.ige-grenoble.fr/" target="_blank">IGE</a>), UGA.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a self motivated young scientist, passionate about understanding the physics of the ocean. I am equally interested in data science and machine learning as it pertains to earth sciences.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I support the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement" target="_blank"> Paris climate aggrement</a> as it reperesents humans consious step towards fighting climate change. It is not a rumor that the climate of our very planet is changing and from current research it is obvious that our activity as humans is largely responsible for this. It is thus imperative for us to collectively work towards cleaning the mess we created.  It is my earnest desire that the we impliment this agreement as planed.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Aside from my scientific idealogy, I strongly believe in an emerging Africa, with bright future ahead for both old and young. A future with robost economy reflecting across the globe, where child education is giving first class piority and the available resources is well managed by those voted into power. If we work together as a united Africa, I believe that we shall rise again.</p>

In case you do not know "Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes — I mean the universe — but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols, in which it is written. This book of nature is written in the language of mathematics, and the symbols are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is impossible to comprehend a single word of it; without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth" (Galileo Galilei, 1623).
