        <title>Msc and Phd Scholarship Tips</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
Getting a scholarship can sometime be very tedious but the stress is worth enduring as the joy of studying at no extra cost from your pocket with state of the art facilities in a conducive environment is worth the application stress. There are couple of things to note if you are interested in applying to the vast numbers of available scholarship oppurtunities. Some scholarships offers are specifically slated for students from developing countries while some are thrown open to all students irrespective of country or gender. Below is a list of the basic things that are needed for application. The list differs depending on the requirement of the scholarship body. However, most of the listed things are always included. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-documents-do-i-need-&quot;&gt;1. What documents do I need ?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;required&quot;&gt;1.1 Required&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Transcript &lt;/b&gt;: Your academic transcripts is a key material for your application. Most of the transcripts comes as a list of your courses with the grades obtained. In my view that is not suffiecient enough because it only gives a course title and not an account of the course synopsis. You should be aware that two courses with the same title might cover different topics and application depending on the university, department or Country. So it is imperative you prepare a synopsis of all the courses you listed in your transcript then attach it to the transcript as a single pdf. Doing this will give the application reviewer a full sense of the skills you acquired from the courses you followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
You can get your transcripts from the Exams and records section of the registrar office of your university. I understand that most universities, for instance in Nigeria are reluctant towards giving out original transcript to students for reasons not clear to me. However, the students' copy normally issued to student is well accepted by some schools but can also be accepted by some universities if it is certified by a Court of Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Statement of Purpose &lt;/b&gt;: One of the most important part of your application is the statement of purpose, it presents you to the admission/scholarship committee as though you are right in front of them. So writing an SOP requires some delicate skills which I shall discuss later my subsequent post. For now you will find &lt;a href=&quot;https://crunchprep.com/gre/2014/powerful-statement-of-purpose&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; crunchprep &lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/msrp/myMSRP/docs/Statement%20of%20purpose%20guidelines.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; MIT SOP Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; very useful towards writting your personal SOP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
Note: Statement of purpose / Letter of Motivation are the same from my pespective with little difference depending on the requiremt of the admission/scholarship board. However some english scholars would argue that &quot;&lt;i&gt;A Letter of Motivation is focusing on what brought you to the program, your history and desires. It addresses why you arrived at where you are &lt;/i&gt; while &lt;i&gt; a Statement of Purpose is focusing on your goals for the program, your future and desires. It addresses what you want to do after you get in &lt;/i&gt; bla bla bla&quot; . if you want to enjoy more engaging argument about the two terms you can check this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-LOM-Letter-of-Motivation-and-SOP-Statement-of-Purpose&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; quora page. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Degree Certificate or Notification of results &lt;/b&gt;: Some institution make a strong demand the degree certificate during the application process but it is not as important as your academic transcript during the process. However, if accepted for admission and granted scholarship. It is compulsory for you to submit a copy of your certificate as an eveidence that you completed the said degree program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Referees &lt;/b&gt;: This is very important as it is pivotal towards the success of your application. The scholarship committee takes the report of a referee seriously and it carries a large mark of your application rating. To this end , it is imperative for you to enlist as a referee a lecturer (preferably a Professor or senior lecturer) that knows about your academic status and your research strength, who is willing and ready to write a comprehensive report about you. A two paragraph reference letter (as is always the case from some lecturers ) would not get you that scholarship of your dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;International Passport &lt;/b&gt;: This is needed at a point in the application processes to confirm your country of origin. You can obtain an international passport from the office of the immigration at any state in your country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;optional-but-important&quot;&gt;1.2 Optional but important&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;TOEFL- Test of English as Foreign Language&lt;/b&gt; : TOEFL as over the years become a necessary exam to be taken by students applying to international programs conducted in English language but who are natives of non English speaking countries. However, students of certain countries (eg Nigeria) are exempted from taking the exams by some universities in Canada, USA and Europe as English is the official language of Nigeria. But its advisable to write the test as it increases your chances of been selected amongst a vast pool of qualified candidates. Detail information about the test, venue , cost and materials can be obtained from the test website. It is worth noting that IELTS serves the same purpose as TOEFL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;GRE- Graduate Record Examination &lt;/b&gt;: GRE is mostly required by universities in USA and Canada for science and engieering oriented courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Letter of English Language proficiency &lt;/b&gt;: In lieu of TOEFL and IELTS, some universities in Nigeria like FUTA do issue Letter of English Language proficiency to support graduate application to foreign universities. You can request for this at the office of the registrar. Also students from institutoins (Irrespective of the country) where English language is the official mode of instruction can equally request for this certificate to be used in lieu of TOEFL/IELTS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;where-and-how-do-i-find-a-scholarship-offer-&quot;&gt;2. Where and how do I find a scholarship offer ?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
Scholarship offers are numerous and many do not find there way to the pages of the websites listed above. To get information about these funding, you need to search the university, laboratory websites or rather punch in some specific key words on google. Graduate/Research assistants positions may be advertised or not, depending on the university. For some universities, you need to contact a potential supervisor then discuss if he/she has research grants to acquire you as a GA for a masters degree or a Phd. Also graduate funding in the US comes mostly as GA positions, so you need to check the website of the Department/University you intend to apply to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-do-i-apply-&quot;&gt;3. How do I apply ?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
Most applications are on-line except for few universities that request for hard-copies. The application procedure will definitely be highlighted in the scholarship advertisement. Most schools in USA will consider your application for both admission and scholarship simultaneously while some universities in Europe would consider you for admission first then you apply for scholarship. However, some offers require you to contact the professor in charge first before further application process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
The application documents might be more complex compared to what I listed above depending on the university requirement. But experience as shown that most application process requires at least those aforementioned documents. Nevertheless, a list of required documents will be made available by the admission committee and you can always send emails requesting for clarification on issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-to-contact-a-potential-supervisor-&quot;&gt;4. How to contact a potential supervisor ?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
This part is mostly usefull for Phd applicants. For students who are not oppurtune to meet a potential supervisor in person for the first meeting then you need to be skillfull in writting a brilliant email that will catch his/her attention. There are dos and dont to this and I personally find the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/advice/prospective.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; talk by Professor David&lt;/a&gt;  good enough as a summary of what you should do and not to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
You can contact me via email if you need further clarification. I hope you find that needed fund to finance your academics. Study hard and attain excellence, I wish you goodluck. Cheers!
&lt;/p&gt;
