SWOT (Surface Water Ocean Topography ) is a future satellite mission that is scheduled to go live in 2021. It is a joint program by NASA (USA), CNES (French Space Agency) with support from the Canadian space agency and the UK Space Agency. SWOT will revolutionise oceanography and hydrology by detecting ocean and river features with 10 times better resolution than present technologies. </p>

Every year, scientists involved in the design, planning and preparation of <a href="https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">SWOT</a> come together to share technical/scientific knowledge on the status of the project. During the meeting, I gave a talk on the variability of eddy scale in the North Atlantic Ocean in anticipation for SWOT as part of the contribution from <a href="http://meom-group.github.io/" target="_blank">MEOM</a> group. </p>
