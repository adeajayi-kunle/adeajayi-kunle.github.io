"The <a href="https://oceanhackweek.github.io/" target="_blank">Oceanhackweek </a> is a 5-day learning hackathon aimed at exploring, creating and promoting effective computation and analysis workflows for large and complex oceanographic data. By democratizing data access and increasing exposure to technological assets, our goals are to accelerate research, promote collaboration and cultivate data science literacy among the ocean sciences community. "</p>

I could not physically attend the Hackathon but I managed to participate remotely with a 9-hour time difference (thanks to JupyterHub).
